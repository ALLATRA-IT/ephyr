Ephyr
=====

[SRS] + [FFmpeg] solution for server-side mixing of live streams powered by [Rust].




## Overview

Ephyr represents a wrapper over [FFmpeg] binary and performs mixing according to specified schema (see [example][1]). At the moment, it's intended to be called as [SRS] `exec.publish` directive, so performs mixing on-demand (when [RTMP] stream is pushed to [SRS]).

Ephyr is able to capture audio from [TeamSpeak] server, and feed it to [FFmpeg] for mixing with [RTMP] stream.




## Try it out

To boot up a simple example, run:
```bash
make up rebuild=yes
```

Now, publish an RTMP stream to `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/input/mic` endpoint either with [OBS], or any other RTMP publisher. You may also use `FFmpeg` for that:
```bash
make publish
```

Finally, play the resulting mixed RTMP stream:
```bash
make play
```

Also, you may tune volume on-fly:
```bash
make tune volume=1 track=music
make tune volume=0.4 track=original
```
